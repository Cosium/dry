# DRY - Use npm across multiple projects without repeating yourself

### Get it

```bash
$ npm i -g dry-dry
```

### Use it

```bash
$ dry init
```

### The copy/paste madness

Because companies and other groups have bunch of `package.json` attributes that are the same across all npm projects.
Those attributes must be maintained using copy/paste across all projects.
This is wrong !

We believe that those attributes should be easily distributed and updated across projects.

### Do not repeat yourself

`dry` is a stupid `npm` wrapper allowing any `package.json` to extend a parent file.
The parent file can be located on the system or simply inside a published npm module.

### How does it work

On each `dry` command, `dry`:

* creates a merged `package.json` based on the provided `package-dry.json`
* runs the `npm` command
* applies the possible `package.json` modifications made by `npm` to `package-dry.json`
* removes `package.json`

`package.json` is always removed to make sure that nobody will execute a pure `npm` command in a `dry` project.

### Inheritance in action

##### Parent project

package-dry.json

```json
{
    "name": "parent",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "description": "",
    "main": "index.js",
    "scripts": {
        "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1",
        "foo": "npm help"
    },
    "keywords": [],
    "author": "",
    "license": "ISC"
}
```

##### Child project

package-dry.json

```json
{
    "name": "child",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "description": "",
    "main": "index.js",
    "scripts": {
        "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
    },
    "keywords": [],
    "author": "",
    "license": "ISC",
    "dry": {
        "extends": "parent/package-dry.json",
        "dependencies": {
            "parent": "1.0.0"
        }
    }
}
```

### package-dry.json

To do that, `dry` introduces a file named `package-dry.json`.
`package-dry.json` replaces `package.json` in your dry projects.
Of course, it can contain all the attributes of `package.json` with the addition of an attribute called `dry`.

package-dry.json `dry` attribute has 2 optional attributes:

* `extends` - The parent of the current dry package
* `dependencies` - The dependencies needed to resolve the file pointed by `extends`. Those dependencies will not be saved to your project.

### dry commands

`dry` proxies all received arguments to `npm`.
Just take your usual npm commands and replace the word `npm` with `dry`.

| npm         | dry         |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| npm init    | dry init    |
| npm i       | dry i       |
| npm install | dry install |
| npm publish | dry publish |
| npm x y z   | dry x y z   |
